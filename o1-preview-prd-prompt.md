Create for me a Product Requirements document based on the following logic:

1. For each requirement, you should provide several options for technologies to use, even if I provide a preferred technology
2. Where possible, select the cost effective and open source options
3. Prioritize simplicity and effectiveness

High-level product summary: A chatbot app called "Mirror" that allows users to upload their own data and interact with it. The focus will be on users capturing their own thoughts and cognitive processes to reflect back to them their own mind (hence the name Mirror). It should allow them to save conversations and summarize their current mind-state over periods of time.

Requirements:
* Cloud hosted (preference: GCP)
* Open-source and extensible chatbot UI
* VectorDB for storing and querying own documents (preference: Chroma)
* Provides a canvas to allow users to write on in addition to chatbot
* Markdown formatted text files
* Allows users to save chatbot conversations and canvas writing
* Chatbot has memory of conversations
* Provides an admin portal where users can manage their document uploads, conversations and memory
