I have an interview for a Pre-Sales Solutions Engineering role at a company called Moveworks, which describes itself as "The AI Copilot that automates employee support". I have been given several different pieces of information that should provide context for the task and scenario. I need to prepare a Sales presentation to present to the internal Sales and Solutions Engineering team as the last step in the interview process

Please help me to plan this presentation based on the context provided below - which defines the scenario as well as some tips from the recruiter in team on how to create a good presentation. I've also uploaded a PDF file into your context with a mock presentation - you can suggest slides to use from the PDF file to use in the presentation.

Please plan a presentation according to the provided context that follows this timeline - each suggested part of the presentation should have a timestamp with how long it should take:

Timeline: In a prep meeting with your main project stakeholders, they have asked for you to cover the following during the 1 hour meeting:  
  - 15 - 20 minutes discussing: 
	  - What are your recommended areas of improvement and why
	  - What product capabilities are required to make these improvements? 
	  - What impact do you project will occur after making these improvements?
- 20 - 25 minute demo providing examples of the required capabilities

Context:

### **Scenario**:

Congratulations, you have been selected as one of two vendors for the opportunity to be chosen as the new enterprise conversational AI solution at a multinational consumer packaged goods company. Your team has been working with this company for 5 months evaluating their current technology and proposing changes that will make a measurable impact on their employee experience.  
  
You will be presenting to a group of 4 - 6 individuals, mostly on the business side on a future state with Moveworks. You have already conducted a [Presales Analysis](https://view.highspot.com/viewer/64eff1a699e71825de076173), which outlines the reasoning why this company is considering Moveworks. The audience is not highly technical, but your champion wants you to provide enough information to convey in some depth how Moveworks will effectively provide the impact promised.

### General Advice:

What a good presentation looks like:

1. Describe the problem the solution solves in detail
    
2. Describe the solution space
    
3. Deep dive into why your solution is the best to address these problems
    
4. Describe the technical details and integration/implementation in enough detail to give an understanding that a non-technical audience could understand, especially if this is a key differentiator (which since this is an interview for a technical role, it should be)
    
5. Be prepared to describe the technical nuances in detail if asked
    
6. Call out other products in that category and talk about what makes your product unique/special
    
7. Talk about something non-obvious about your product (that you wouldn’t find on the website or after 5 mins of googling)
    

Other things to keep in mind:

- Good presentation skills ... be engaging. able to talk confidently and clearly without selling too hard
    
- Ability to cover breadth and (some) depth
    
- Don’t just point and click, describe a story around the scenario if possible 
    
- Ensure the audience understands the topic you're presenting. Don't throw jargon and acronyms and assume the audience has familiarity
    
- Providing detail to the audience on what you’re wanting to achieve with this demo and where it would be placed in a normal sales cycle is a huge plus as it provides context to what we should ask and what you’re trying to deliver
